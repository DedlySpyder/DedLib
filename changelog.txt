  Breaking Changes:

    - Tester - Reworked Tester.run() output to return a full mapping of test results (doesn't break adding/running tests, only the results)

    - Tester/Mock - Moved Tester mocks to `Tester.Mock` or `modules/testing/mock.lua`

  Changes:
    - Tester - Added optional `args`, `generateArgsFunc`, and `generateArgsFuncArgs` parameters when adding test(s) to supply to the test function
    - Tester - Added optional `before` and `beforeArgs` to tests and testers, which will skip tests if they fail
    - Tester - Added optional `after` and `afterArgs` to tests and testers, to cleanup resources
    - Tester/Assert - Added several new asserts
    - Logger - Updated to use Stringify under the hood
    - Logger - Added "file:line" after the mod name (or prefix if included) on all log messages
    - Logger - Rewrote logger to use inheritance from a root logger which uses DedLib settings, to support moving the log level settings to runtime
    - Logger - Allow logger to change console log level mid game (must call __DedLib__/internal/logger `.on_init()` in script.on_init())
